# Koji H: Interactive RSS Feed Reader

_July 10, 2025_

[Koji H](https://kj-9.github.io/marimo-rss-reader/) presents a notebook that turns RSS URLs into an interactive feed reader. The notebook fetches and parses RSS XML into Pydantic data models, shows raw XML and a table of entries, and offers date-grouped sidebar navigation with search.
