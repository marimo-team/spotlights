# Harry Vangberg: SNP to Primer Pairs

_July 3, 2025_

[Harry Vangberg](https://harry.vangberg.name) presents a notebook for SNP to primer pairs with no more BLAST backlogs. This notebook fetches the SNP's flanking sequence from Ensembl, designs primers via Primer3 and runs local BLAST â€” all in under ~5 s per tweak.

Harry is studying biotechnology at Aalborg University, after more than a decade working as a software developer, product leader, and startup co-founder.
