_May 29, 2025_

[Hampus Londögård](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hampus-lond%C3%B6g%C3%A5rd/) presents a marimo notebook that performs object detection entirely in-browser with zero servers. The notebook uses Pyodide to proxy transformers-js-py and onnxruntime for on-device DETR (DEtection TRansformer) — upload an image or URL for instant bounding boxes.

Hampus is a Senior Machine Learning Engineer & AI Cloud Lead at Verisure. He has worked with multiple technologies across the Data & AI space and currently enjoys working with highly efficient local tools such as Polars and training models using PyTorch.
