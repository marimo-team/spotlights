# David O'Sullivan: MapWeaver - Styled GeoJSON Maps

_June 19, 2025_

[David O'Sullivan](https://dosull.github.io) presents MapWeaver, which weaves data into styled maps in-browser with no JavaScript needed. MapWeaver loads GeoJSON, maps variables to tile or weave patterns, allows tweaking of spacing, rotation & scale, then exports your map.

David is a talented problem solver, researcher, analyst, and communicator with wide-ranging geospatial skills. He has experience in data wrangling, analysis, and visualization, with specific expertise in spatial analysis and simulation modelling. He has taught at universities for over 20 years and published three books on spatial analysis, spatial simulation & geographical computing.
